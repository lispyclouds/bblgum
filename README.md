[![bb compatible](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babashka/babashka/master/logo/badge.svg)](https://babashka.org)

An _extremely_ tiny and simple wrapper around the awesome [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).

This is intended for [babashka](https://babashka.org/) and JVM clojure and provides an idiomatic and data driven wrapper around the CLI tool.

## Requirements
- Gum should be [installed](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#installation)
- Babashka or the Clojure JVM runtime, latest recommended

## Usage

Add this to your `bb.edn` or `deps.edn`:
```edn
{:deps {io.github.lispyclouds/bblgum {:git/sha "7ebae0e2231899fe2a6ad44bc9ef5fca64099fcd"}}}
```

Sample babashka usage:
```console
$ bb -Sdeps '{:deps {io.github.lispyclouds/bblgum {:git/sha "7ebae0e2231899fe2a6ad44bc9ef5fca64099fcd"}}}' \
     -e "(require '[bblgum.core :as b]) (b/gum :input :placeholder \"User name:\")"
```

## Interaction

This follows the same [section](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#interaction) on the gum repo and all params should work verbatim.
Run `gum <cmd> --help` to discover all the params and args.

This lib only has _one_ public fn: `bblgum.core/gum`.

## Standard Usage
`gum` tries to closely mimic the usage of the CLI tool, so it works like `(gum :COMMAND)`,
`(gum :COMMAND [ARGS])` or `(gum :COMMAND [ARGS] :OPTION VALUE :OPTION2 VALUE)`

```clojure
(require '[bblgum.core :as b])
```

Examples:
```clojure 
;; Command only:
(b/gum :file)

;; Command with args:
(b/gum :choose ["arg1" "arg2"])

;; Command with opts:
(b/gum :file :directory true)

;; Command with opts and args:
(b/gum :choose ["arg1" "arg2"] :header "Choose an option")
```


There are several special opts, that are handled by the library:

`:in` - An input stream than can be passed to gum
`:as` - Coerce the output. Currently supports :bool, :ignored or defaults to a seq of strings
`:gum-path` - Path to the gum binary. Defaults to `gum`

All other opts are passed to the CLI. Consult `gum CMD --help` to see available options.  
To pass flags like `--directory` use `:directory true`. Always use full names of the options.

Example with special options:
```clojure
(gum :table :in (io/input-stream f) :height 10)
```

### Usage Examples

#### input 
```clojure 
(b/gum :choose ["foo" "bar" "baz"] :no-limit true)

{:status 0 :result ("foo" "baz")}
```

#### write 
```clojure 
(b/gum :write)
```

#### filter
```clojure
(b/gum :filter :in (clojure.java.io/input-stream "flavours.txt"))

(b/gum :filter :in (clojure.java.io/input-stream "flavours.txt") :no-limit true)
```

#### confirm

```clojure
(b/gum :confirm :as  :bool)
```

#### file

```clojure
(b/gum :file ["src"])
```

#### pager

```clojure
(b/gum :pager :as :ignored :in (clojure.java.io/input-stream "README.md"))
```

#### spin

```clojure
(b/gum :spin ["sleep" "5"] :spinner "line" :title "Buying Bubble Gum...")
```

### table

```clojure
(b/gum :table :in (clojure.java.io/input-stream "flavours.csv"))
```

All of the rest of the options and usecases _should work_ ™. Please raise issues/PRs for any improvements. Much appreciated!

## Caveats

- Since this uses gum which expects an interactive TTY like terminal, this is not possible to be used from editor REPLs like Conjure, CIDER, Calva etc **when jacked-in**.
  To use this from an editor REPL:
    - First start the REPL in a terminal, for example in bb for nREPL on port 1667: `bb nrepl-server 1667`.
    - Connect to the port from the editor of your choice, for example with neovim and conjure: `:ConjureConnect 1667`.
    - Perform the usual REPL interactions and all the gum output would appear on the terminal and not your editor but the result should be on the editor as expected.

## Low-level API
This was standard in previous versions of gum, we kept it for full backward compatibility.

Convention:
- The main command should be passed as a keyword or string to `:cmd`. Required
- Passing opts:
  - The --opts are to be passed as `:opts`
  - Use the full forms of the opts: `--spinner` not `-s`
  - Seqs can be passed to opts taking multiple params as well
  - Pass boolean flags like `--password` as `{:password true}`
- All positional args to be passed as `:args`.
- An input stream can be passed to `:in`. Useful for commands like [filter](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#filter)
- Corece the output:
  - Treat non-zero exit codes from gum as a booleans passing `:as :bool`
  - Ignore it with `:ignored`. This ignores parsing of the stdout
  - `:bool` is useful for commands like [confirm](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#confirm)
  - `:ignored` is useful for [pager](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#pager). Ignoring the parsing of the output helps the pager actually draw things
  - Defaults to a seq of strings
- Override the default gum path of `gum` by passing it via `:gum-path`

The `gum` fn returns a map of exit status of calling gum and the result either as a seq of lines or coerced via `:as`.
Exceptions are not thrown unless calling gum itself does, the status code is intended for programming for failures.


```clojure
(b/gum {:cmd :choose
        :opts {:no-limit true}
        :args ["foo" "bar" "baz"]})

{:status 0 :result ("foo" "baz")}
```
